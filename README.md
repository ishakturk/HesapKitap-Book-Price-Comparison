## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of technologies to deliver a robust and feature-rich experience.  The core technologies employed include:

*   **Spring Boot:** The foundation of the application, providing auto-configuration, dependency injection, and a streamlined development experience.
*   **Spring Web:** Enables the creation of a web application, handling HTTP requests and responses.
*   **Spring Security:** Implements authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the application's resources.  Specifically, Spring Security is used for user authentication and password encryption using bcrypt.
*   **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database access by reducing the amount of boilerplate code required for common database operations.  It provides an abstraction over JPA (Java Persistence API), making it easier to interact with the database.
*   **Thymeleaf:** A server-side Java template engine used for creating dynamic and interactive front-end views.  Thymeleaf allows for the seamless integration of data with HTML, simplifying front-end development.
*   **MySQL:** A relational database management system used for persistent data storage, including user information, book details, and wishlist items.
*   **Jsoup:** A Java library for parsing HTML.  It is used for web scraping, extracting book prices and other relevant information from various e-commerce websites.
*   **Java Concurrency Utilities:**  The application leverages Java's concurrency utilities (e.g., ExecutorService, Future) for parallel processing of price fetching tasks, resulting in improved performance.

In summary, the project utilizes a modern and effective technology stack, combining the power of Spring Boot for backend development, Spring Data JPA for simplified database interaction, Thymeleaf for the front-end, MySQL for database, and Jsoup for web scraping.  This combination allows for the creation of a scalable, secure, and user-friendly book price comparison platform.
